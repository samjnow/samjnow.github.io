        <p>     The aim of this project was to create three photomontages. While constructing self portraits of our mind, body, and spirit, we were also practicing  non-destructive editing programs.
        </p>
        <p>     It usually takes me some time to “incubate” to fully plan projects, but this one was different. I have done a similar project and was able to incorporate those details into this assignment. From that, I learned to expand my style, thinking of the bigger picture instead of sticking to what I normally would. While planning a triptych, it is important to think of them as a single piece, not three individual works. That idea is what helped me achieve the final collages.
        </p>
        <p>     I was heavily influenced by modern photomontage artists, specifically Marian Williams and Eduardo Argoud, along with Dadaist art. After finishing my “spirit” collage, I became aware that I was also influenced by “Riot Grrrl” and other zines from the era. It was unconscious, but it still seeped through to my work. I hope I make Kathleen Hanna proud.
        </p>
        <p>     I believe I was able to represent my mind, body, and spirit well. I have been using Photoshop for six years but was still able to learn new techniques during this project.
